# Towards Improved Research Methodologies for Industrial AI: A Critical Examination using Automated Optical Inspection False Call Reduction as a Case Study - Source code
This is the source code of the publication 'Towards Improved Research Methodologies for Industrial AI: A Critical Examination using Automated Optical Inspection False Call Reduction as a Case Study' and shall enable reproducible results.  
The main scripts are standard_models.py, autoML_models.py and dummy_model.py. They require a local MLFlow server running, as the results are logged there. 
Our results are included in the repository in the /notebooks/runs folder. The evaluation is done in the runs_eval.ipynb in /notebooks/ . 
AutoML models require a linux environment and also changes in the pyproject.toml file as there are incompatibilities with the package imbalanced-learn and auto-sklearn. 
For double-blind review, the dataset from the git lfs will not be available as the tool for anonymizing the repo (https://anonymous.4open.science/) does not support git lfs at this moment. For this purpose, a subset of the dataset, the first 100 000 rows are given in an extra .csv file. However, the originally experiments were obviously executed with the full dataset.
